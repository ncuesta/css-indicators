# css-indicators

Pure CSS3 work indicators (a.k.a. Ajax loaders).

## Usage

Download either [the minified](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/build/css-indicators.min.css) or [the regular](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/build/css-indicators.css) version of the CSS file and include it in your page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- This is the important bit -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="css/css-indicators.min.css" />
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

And then you can use the provided JS helper (in the form of a jQuery plugin) or add the
needed markup for the themed indicator (see below).

## jQuery plugin

`css-indicators` comes bundled with a tiny but handy [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin.

By using it, you won't have to go through the hassle of dealing with the correct markup
for each indicator theme. You'll just have to do a `$('#my-indicator').indicator()`
optionally specified with a couple of options.

### Usage

After you've included the CSS file for the indicators, you will need to add
[the JS file](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/js/css-indicators-generator.js)
or its [minified version](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/js/css-indicators-generator.min.js)
to your jQuery-enabled page. **Remember to add it after your jQuery `<script>` tag!**

Once you have included the JS file, you can then use it with any existing element on the page:

```js
jQuery(function($) {
    // With the default options
    $('#default-indicator').indicator();
    //  -> Will produce a 'spinner', 'normal', with 9 bars.

    // Only specifying the theme
    $('#themed-indicator').indicator('bouncer');

    // Providing a hash of options
    $('#customized-indicator').indicator({ theme: 'pulsar', size: 'x-large' });
});
```

### Available options

The available options for the plugin are:

* `theme`: The theme to use - `'spinner'` by default, but could be any of the themes listed below.
* `size`: The size: `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'normal'` (default), `'large'`, `'x-large'`.
* `extra`: Extra classes to define on the container. Defaults to `''` (an empty string).
* `bars`:  Number of child bars to add to the `spinner` theme. Only valid for that theme. Defaults to `9`.

## Indicator themes

### Global CSS class names

First of all, you should know that every indicator must have the `.indicator` class
name.

For every indicator theme you can specify its size via a class name. This is optional,
and will default to a sensible value. Available sizes are: `.small`, `.medium`,
`.normal` (the default size), `.large` and `.x-large`.

### Spinner

This theme displays an animated spinner with bars.

#### The markup

This indicator requires the following markup (please note that the specific classes
described in the next section might change for your particular use case):

```html
<!-- The spinner needs a container element -->
<span class="indicator spinner normal bars-9">
    <!-- And a set of bars to draw, in this case 9 as .bars-9 requires -->
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
</span>
```

#### The CSS

This indicator uses the `.spinner` class name, and relies on a class that states
the number of bars it should show.

For the number of bars you must use a class that indicates how many bar elements
the spinner has in the form `.bars-X`, where `X` is a number between `3` and `36`.

### Bouncer

This theme displays a nice little ball bouncing up and down in a neverending loop.

#### The markup

This indicator requires the following markup (please note that the specific classes
described in the next section might change for your particular use case):

```html
<!-- The bouncer needs a container element -->
<span class="indicator bouncer normal with-floor">
    <!-- And the ball that will be bouncing inside the container -->
    <span class="ball"></span>
</span>
```

### Pulsar

This theme displays a nice little ball pulsing in a neverending loop.

#### The markup

```html

<span class="indicator pulsar normal">
    <!-- And the ball that will be pulsing inside the container -->
    <span class="ball"></span>
</span>
```

#### The CSS

### Squared

</span>
```

#### The CSS

This indicator uses the `.loopy` class and can optionally have slightly rounded corners
if you use the `.rounded` class.

### FBlocks

This theme displays a facebook-like blocks animation.

#### The markup

This indicator requires the following markup (please note that the specific classes
described in the next section might change for your particular use case):

```html

    <span class="block"></span>
    <span class="block"></span>
    <span class="block"></span>
